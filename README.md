# ConstructionMLVisualization
 
This is a pilot implementation of construction site machine learning visualization.

Under assets/scenes, you can find 2 scenes for task 4 and 5.

##Task 4 Productivity (Cycle)

Visualization interface for different Excavator / Dump Truck activity cycle. When space key is pressed, the project start to play a video on the right side. Meanwhile the activity cycle is defined in seconds, configured in scene manager, so that bottom left shows different activity stages, top left shows a bird's eyeview which is individual png images made with draw.io. So we will need to manually input video, timestamps and corresponding activity stages. 



##Task 5 Fleet Balancing.

Just begin working on it, currently only do 1. read csv, 2. display text. Ideally, this project can read processed csv file indicating machine's status, so it can play video and at the same time visualize the efficiency.
